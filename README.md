I was very exciteing about the method of putting together the HTML content first and gradually apply layouts and styles one by one. It helped visualize the intereaction between layers and the scipt I need later in the project.
The challenge I aced was not know all the function and capability of dev tool. I was jumping in and out of the studyhall looking for assistent.
